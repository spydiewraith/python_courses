#PEMDAS - Order of Operations
#Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Substraction, by this means addition = substraction vice versa, and that divsion becomes multiplication, i.e:
# 5(2x + 4) - 7(9 - 3) = 4(9x + 9) - 9
# 5 x 2x + 5 x 4 = 10x + 20 
# 7(9 - 3) = 9 - 3 = 6 = 7 x 6 = 42
# 4(9x + 9) = 36x + 36 
# 10x + 20 - 42  = 36x + 36 - 9
# 10x - 22 = 36x + 27
# 10x - 36x = 22 + 27 
# -26x = 49
# x=49 
#  -26
